#WWW Version 1 Spec
* This version will just be a prototype for basic controls, physics and display
functionality.
* It will be a single machine, client only version. The second player won't have mouse controls and only exists as a test dummy.

#Mechanics
###Map
* Square, two Bases and no other structures.
* Base takes 10 hits to kill.
* No turrets or projectiles yet.

###Warriors
* Both circles.
* Right-to-left quarter-circle Slash.
* Dash quadruples move speed for 0.5 seconds, brief invincibility.
* No parry.
* Three hits kill.

#Model
* Parent object to all game entities.
* Coordinates and dimensions written as fractions of max value, between 0 and 1.
###Instance Data
* tick;
	* Current tick number.
* pc;
	* The two player characters.
* base;
	* The bases.
* grid;
	* Spatial hash map for collisions.
###Methods
 * update(model);
	* Take a model, clone it, simulate the next tick and return the update.
	* Countdown timers, process attack hits.
	* Move entities according to velocity, update grid.
	* Scan for & process collisions.

##Entity
* Super class of all visible objects.
###Static Data
* SPEED;
	* Max velocity per tick.
* MAX_HP;
* WIDTH, HEIGHT
	* Half width and height of collision AABB.
	* i.e. Distance of box edges from centre.
###Instance Data
* team;
	*  0 for P1, 1 for P2.
* x,y;
	* Object centre.
* dX,dY;
	* Velocity as position change per-tick.
* hp;
* r;
	* Angle of rotation where positive y axis = 0.
###Methods
* accelerate(aX,aY);
	* Add velocity to entity, normalise to SPEED.
* stop();
	* Set velocity to 0.
* turn(deg);
	* Set entity rotation.
* collide(entity);
	* Enact result of colliding with the given entity.
	* Overloaded for different entity subtypes.
* cut();
	* Triggered when hit by player slash.

##Warrior
###Static Data
* SLASH_DUR, DASH_DUR;
	* Duration of slash and dash.
* SLASH_CD, DASH_CD, RES_CD;
	* Cooldown time of respawn, dash and slash.
* DASH_SP;
	* Speed when dashing.
* SLASH_RNG;
	* Length of sword.
* SLASH_ANG;
	* Half-angle of sword swing.
###Instance Data
* slashT, dashT;
	* Current status timers of slash and dash.
	* If >0 denotes ticks since action began. If <0 denotes ticks left on cooldown.
* resT;
	* Respawn timer. <0 indicates waiting to spawn.
###Methods
* slash(), dash();
	* Initiate slash or dash.

#View
###Data
* ScreenX, ScreenY;
	* Dimensions of the client's browser window.
* Screen
	* Context of the main canvas that occupies the whole screen.
* Sprites
	* Hidden canvases rendered at load time, drawn on main canvas as pre-rendered images.
	* Rendering at load allows adjusting to different resolutions while also avoiding per-frame rendering.

#Controllers
* Is this really an MVC application? Dunno, but the terminology works so I'm using it.

##Client
###Data
* MAX_DELAY;
	* Max number of ticks to keep in history.
	* Also how far behind the server the client can fall.
* history;
	* Collection of recent model states.
	* Only need one when there's no network delay to worry about, but I want to see the performance impact.
	* Rather than adding/removing elements dynamically, will wrap around a fix sized array overwriting old elements.
###Functions
* main();
	* Game loop.
* KeyPress(e), KeyUp(e), MouseDown(e);
	* Handlers to register with input events.
	* Trigger appropriate method on PC.
* MouseMove(e);
	* Orient PC by calculating relative angle of pointer and PC.
