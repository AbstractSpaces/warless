##Model

  * Parent to all game entities.
  * Coordinates and dimensions written as fractions of max value, between 0 and
    1.
* Instance Data
  * pc; The two player characters.
  * base; The bases.
  * grid; Spatial hash map for collisions.
    * Maps AABB to the grid cells they occupy.
    * Cells sized so no object can span more than 4 cells.
    * Key/value type where cells are mapped to keys as needed.
    * TBD if this should be a separate class.
* Methods
  * update(inputs); Take a list of commands and update the model.

###Entity
* Notes
  * Super class of all visible objects.
* Static Data
  * SPEED; Magnitude of velocity.
  * MAX_HP;
  * WIDTH, HEIGHT; Half width and height of collision AABB.
* Instance Data
  * x,y; Centre of sprite.
  * vX, vY; Velocity per-tick vector.
  * hp;
  * r; Angle of rotation where positive y axis = 0.
* Methods
  * collide(entity); Enact result of colliding with the given entity.

####Warrior
* Static Data
  * SLASH_D, DASH_D; Duration of slash and dash.
  * SLASH_CD, DASH_CD; Cooldown time of dash and slash.
* Instance Data
  * slashT, dashT; Current status timers of slash and dash.
    * If >0 denotes ticks since action began. If <0 denotes ticks left on
      cooldown.

##View

##Controller
* Notes
  * Is this really an MVC application? Dunno, but the terminology works so I'm
  using it.
