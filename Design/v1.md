#WWW Version 1 Spec
* This version will just be a prototype for basic controls, physics and display
functionality.
* It will be a single machine, client only version. The second player won't have controls and only exists as a test dummy.
* Loosely following an MVC pattern to keep concerns separated and my sanity intact.

##Mechanics
###Map
* Square, two Bases and no other structures.
* Base takes 10 hits to kill.
* No turrets or projectiles yet.

###Warriors
* Both circles.
* Right-to-left quarter-circle Slash.
* Dash quadruples move speed for 0.5 seconds, brief invincibility.
* No parry.
* Three hits kill.

##Model
* Using Victor.js for vector calculations. My uni transcript is evidence enough that I know how to do them manually and I won't be innovating on how they are implemented, so this just saves some time.
* Describing coordinates and dimensions as between 0 and 1. Hoping to multiply with canvas size to adapt to different resolutions.

###Collisions
* By far the biggest headache at these initial stages.

####Broad phase:
* Divide map into a discrete grid, cells sized so no object can span more than 2 cells along either axis.
* Create a mapping structure to associate game objects with the cell grids they occupy.
* Give each object a bounding box, objects mapped to the cells that each box corner lies in.
* Only check for collisions against objects sharing a cell.

####Grid Map


####Narrow phase:
* This version has 2 circular objects and 2 rectangular ones. Possible collisions are circle-circle and circle-rectangle.
* Circle-circle: check if the distance between centres is less than the sum of their radii.
* Circle-rectangle:
	* If two corners of circle bounding box are inside rectangle, there's a head-on collision with one rectangle side.
	* If only one corner is inside, there may or may not be a collision at a rectangle corner.
	* In this case, check if distance between corner vertex and circle centre is less than its radius.
