#WWW Version 1 Spec
* This version will just be a prototype for basic controls, physics and display
functionality.
* It will be a single machine, client only version. The second player won't have controls and only exists as a test dummy.
* Loosely following an MVC pattern to keep concerns separated and my sanity intact.

##Mechanics
###Map
* Square, two Bases and no other structures.
* Base takes 10 hits to kill.
* No turrets or projectiles yet.

###Warriors
* Both circles.
* Right-to-left quarter-circle Slash.
* Dash quadruples move speed for 0.5 seconds, brief invincibility.
* No parry.
* Three hits kill.

##2D Space
* Describing coordinates and dimensions as between 0 and 1. Hoping to multiply with canvas size to adapt to different resolutions.

##Collisions
* By far the biggest headache at these initial stages.

###Broad phase:
* Divide map into a discrete grid, cells sized so no object can span more than 2 cells along either axis.
* Create a mapping structure to associate game objects with the cell grids they occupy.
* Give each object a bounding box, objects mapped to the cells that each box corner lies in.
* Only check for collisions against objects sharing a cell.

###Narrow phase:
* This version has 2 circular objects and 2 rectangular ones. Possible collisions are circle-circle and circle-rectangle.
* Circle-circle: check if the distance between centres is less than the sum of their radii.
* Circle-rectangle:
	* If two corners of circle bounding box are inside rectangle, there's a head-on collision with one rectangle side.
	* If only one corner is inside, there may or may not be a collision at a rectangle corner.
	* In this case, check if distance between corner vertex and circle centre is less than its radius.

##Dev Journal
* Using Victor.js for vector calculations. My uni transcript is evidence enough that I know how to do them manually and I won't be innovating on how they are implemented, so this just saves some time.

* Despite avoiding my usual mistake and planning thoroughly before coding, I've still managed to end up lost in a swamp of inheritance and interfaces. A flaw in the paradigm, or my incompetence? Either way I want to try a new approach.

* That "new approach" ended up being a long and painful journey of making everything static and procedural (pain to work with all those parameters), imitating functional programming by exclusively using composition over inheritance (needlessly complex for types with an obvious hierarchy), learning that TypeScript class methods can be reassigned and spending days learning about the language's implementation of classes and how I could make my own system with immutable methods (a) an unnecessary feature that I really just wanted to see if I could produce, and b) any usable approach would either be convoluted and unreadable or involve redefining methods inside the class definition, introducing inefficiency), then just now figuring out you can make TypeScript methods immutable by casting the object to an interface with that method as a readonly property and finally feeling confident in my understanding of the tools and options available and how I should use them. It wasn't fun, but I think the journey was fruitful.
