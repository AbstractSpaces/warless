This is just a list of ideas I haven't fleshed out yet.

* Geometric shaped assets. Different shapes have different attack patterns.
* Black background, neon colours and lights. Let's go full Geometry Wars.
* Project attack area in front of character as neon underglow, provide orientation and telegraphing.
* Combat: Slash (R click, visible sword swing, small recovery), Parry (L click, project sword forward, stop intercepted slash and cause longer attack recovery. Unsuccessful parry longer recovery, successful no recovery), Dash (Shift, Dark Souls dodge, small recovery. Hold to sprint).
* Powerups: Power (next melee longer range, high damage), Mass (automatically deflect next attack received), Speed (next dash extreme range, damages objects in path).
