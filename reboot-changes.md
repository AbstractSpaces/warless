# Why?

After some time away, I came back feeling a new approach would benefit this project. I'm proud of some of the work I've already done, but my workflow was becoming increasingly directionless as I didn't have a particularly good plan.

# What?

First up, I'm switching from using Visual Studio to VS Code for managing the project. I've been using Visual Studio for another project and while it can be handy, I'm getting tired of not understanding what half the files in my project actually do and using only a fraction of the IDE's UI buttons. This new approach will be probably be more work, but hopefully I can at least learn and understand the build system I'm using. Plus, VS Code is just prettier and nicer to write with.

Second, I'm taking a break from working on data models and controllers in order to prioritise an operational main event loop and server setup. A lot of the indecision I felt before the hiatus was a result of not knowing how my (ingenious and well written) game systems would actually be used by the input/output logic. Also, if I have a minimal but working main loop it'll be a lot easier to test the functionality of everything else.
